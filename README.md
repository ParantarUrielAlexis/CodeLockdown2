Description:"Code Lockdown" is a fast-paced typing game in which players must safeguard their home from a break-in by rapidly changing a security code before time runs out. As a homeowner on vacation, you receive notification that a burglar is attempting to hack into your home's security system. The only thing that stands between the burglar and your house is your ability to change the passcode in time.

Your objective is to survive 8 rounds of code upgrades in order to outwit the thief and safeguard your home. In each round, you are given a password that must be entered properly before the timer runs out. As you proceed, each successful password update adds time to the clock, but the pressure builds as the passcodes grow more complicated.
